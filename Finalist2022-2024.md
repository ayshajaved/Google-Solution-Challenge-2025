### Report: Comprehensive Analysis of GDGoC Solution Challenge Finalists

This report provides a detailed examination of the finalists from the Google Developer Group on Campus (GDGoC) Solution Challenge for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, focusing on the top 10 finalists each year, their project details, and the most popular products. The analysis addresses the user's request for project names, descriptions, linking profile links, and information about owners and contributors, including potential sources like GitHub repositories.

#### Background and Context

The GSC Solution Challenge, organized by Google, is an annual competition inviting university students to develop solutions for real-world problems using Google technologies, aligned with the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The challenge has been running since 2020, with participants forming teams to create innovative projects. The competition involves multiple rounds, typically selecting top 100 or top 50 teams initially, followed by top 10 finalists, and finally announcing the top 3 winners, often with a People's Choice award.

For the years in question, 2022 saw a top 50 selection, while 2023 and 2024 expanded to top 100, reflecting growing participation. The current analysis, covers the most recent data available, focusing on the top 10 finalists for each year due to the user's preference for top 10 or among top 100/top 50.

#### Methodology

Information was gathered through official Google Developer pages, including the GSC Solution Challenge winners page [GSC Solution Challenge Winners | Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge/winners), and supplemented by demo day videos available on YouTube. Efforts to find public GitHub repositories for each project were made, but many projects did not have publicly accessible repositories, limiting direct links to project code. Instead, demo day videos and official pages were used to provide access to project details.

#### Detailed Findings

##### 2022 Finalists

The 2022 challenge selected top 50 teams initially, with the following top 10 finalists identified:

| Project Name | Description                                      | Team Members                                      | University                                      | Demo Day Video Link                                      |
