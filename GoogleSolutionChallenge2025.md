### Part 1: Google Solution Challenge 2025

#### What is the Google Solution Challenge?
- **Overview**: The Google Solution Challenge 2025 is a global competition organized by Google, designed specifically for university students. In this challenge, you create a project—a working solution like an app, website, or tool—using Google technologies to tackle a real-world problem connected to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These problems could range from ending poverty to fighting climate change or improving health. Your project must use at least one Google tool, like Firebase, TensorFlow, or Google Cloud, to make it happen.
- **Purpose**: It’s all about helping you grow your coding skills, learn how to work in a team (if you choose to), and make a positive difference in the world. Think of it as a chance to practice tech while solving issues that matter.
- **Who It’s For**: This is for university students—like you!—who are enrolled in a college or university (undergraduate or graduate). You need to be part of a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) or willing to join one. GDSCs are student groups supported by Google to learn and build tech together.

#### What Do We Have to Build?
- You’ll build a **functional solution**—a piece of tech (e.g., a mobile app, web app, or hardware-software combo) that solves a specific problem tied to one or more of the 17 SDGs. It’s not just an idea or mockup; it needs to work and show real impact.
- Examples: An app to connect farmers to markets (SDG 1: No Poverty), a tool to track air quality (SDG 13: Climate Action), or an AI system to detect diseases (SDG 3: Good Health).

#### What Are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
The SDGs are global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 to make the world better by 2030. Here’s the full list:
1. **No Poverty**: End poverty everywhere.
2. **Zero Hunger**: Ensure everyone has enough food.
3. **Good Health and Well-being**: Help people live healthier lives.
4. **Quality Education**: Make education accessible to all.
5. **Gender Equality**: Empower women and girls equally.
6. **Clean Water and Sanitation**: Provide safe water and toilets.
7. **Affordable and Clean Energy**: Use sustainable energy sources.
8. **Decent Work and Economic Growth**: Create good jobs.
9. **Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**: Build smart systems and tech.
10. **Reduced Inequalities**: Make life fairer for everyone.
11. **Sustainable Cities and Communities**: Make cities safe and green.
12. **Responsible Consumption and Production**: Use resources wisely.
13. **Climate Action**: Fight climate change.
14. **Life Below Water**: Protect oceans and sea life.
15. **Life on Land**: Save forests and animals.
16. **Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions**: Build fair societies.
17. **Partnerships for the Goals**: Work together globally.

Your project picks one (or more) of these and solves a related problem—big or small, local or global!

#### What Are the Solutions That Might Be?
- Solutions depend on the SDG you choose. Here are some ideas:
  - **SDG 4 (Education)**: A virtual classroom app for remote students.
  - **SDG 2 (Hunger)**: A map showing free food locations.
  - **SDG 3 (Health)**: An AI tool to spot eye diseases early.
  - **SDG 11 (Cities)**: A safety app with SOS alerts for women.
- It’s up to you—focus on something you care about or a problem in Pakistan (e.g., clean water access in rural areas).

#### How to Use Technologies?
- You’ll use Google technologies to build your solution. This means integrating tools like:
  - **Firebase**: For storing data or user logins in your app.
  - **TensorFlow**: For adding AI/ML features (e.g., predicting trends).
  - **Google Cloud**: For hosting or scaling your project.
- Example: If you’re making a health app, use TensorFlow to analyze medical data and Firebase to save user info. You code how these tools work together to solve your chosen problem.

#### What Are All the Technologies or AI We Can Use?
- You must use at least one Google technology. Here’s a list of options:
  - **Firebase**: Manages app data and users.
  - **TensorFlow**: Builds AI/ML models (e.g., image recognition).
  - **Google Cloud Platform**: Runs big projects or stores data.
  - **Flutter**: Creates apps for Android and iOS.
  - **Android**: Makes mobile apps.
  - **Google Maps Platform**: Adds maps or location features.
  - **Gemini API**: Powers AI chatbots or text tools.
  - **Google Assistant**: Adds voice commands.
  - **Wear OS**: For smartwatch apps.
  - Others: Angular, GoLang, DialogFlow, Vertex AI, etc.
- **AI or Not?**: You can use AI (like TensorFlow or Gemini) if it fits your project, but it’s not required. Simple apps without AI are fine too!

#### Does the Code Have to Be Self-Written?
- **Yes**, your code must be original and written by your team. You can’t just copy someone else’s project or use pre-built apps. However:
  - You can use Google’s libraries (e.g., TensorFlow models) or open-source snippets as building blocks, but the main solution—how it works and solves the problem—must be your own creation.
  - Include a GitHub link with your code and a README explaining how to run it.

#### What Do We Have to Submit as a Solution?
- You submit two things by the deadline (likely March 28, 2025):
  1. **Demo Video**: A 2-minute video showing your project in action. Show how it works, how users use it, and how Google tech helps. Upload it to YouTube (public or unlisted).
  2. **Project Submission**: A form with:
     - Team info (names, university, contact).
     - Project details (SDG chosen, Google tech used, problem solved).
     - Links to your video and GitHub repo with your code.
- Judges test your code and watch your video to score you.

#### Can I Participate Solo or Twice (Solo and Team)?
- **Solo Participation**: Yes, you can join alone! Teams can be 1-4 people, so solo is allowed.
- **Twice (Solo + Team)**: No, you can only submit one project per year. You must choose: solo or with a team. Submitting twice (e.g., solo and as a team member) isn’t allowed per the rules.
- **Tip**: Teaming up can split the work and bring more skills, but solo lets you control everything.

#### Is It Strictly Compulsory to Be a GDSC Member?
- **Yes**, at least one team member must be part of a GDSC at submission time. Since you’re in GDGoC (similar to GDSC), you’re likely eligible—check with your group! If not:
  - Join a GDSC at goo.gle/solutionchallenge or a nearby one if COMSATS doesn’t have it. It’s free and open to university students.
- **Not in GDG**: GDG (Google Developer Group) is different (for pros, not students). GDSC membership is the requirement here.

#### Other Questions and Queries
- **Can I Use Non-Google Tech?**: Yes, but at least one Google tool must be central to your solution. Add Python, HTML, etc., as needed.
- **What If I’m New to Coding?**: No problem! The challenge is beginner-friendly. Use free tutorials (e.g., TensorFlow.org) and your GDSC for help.
- **Pakistan-Specific Rules?**: No extra rules—just follow the global ones. Prizes are adjusted for Pakistan’s economy (Purchasing Power Parity).
- **Can I Join Late?**: Register early (Jan 2025), but you can start building anytime before the March deadline.
- **What If My Idea’s Taken?**: No worries—make your version unique (e.g., focus on Lahore’s needs).
- **Prizes?**: Top 100 get swag and mentorship; Top 10 get more; Top 3 get $3,000 USD per member (up to $12,000 per team).
