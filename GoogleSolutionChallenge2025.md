## Part 1: Google Solution Challenge 2025

### What is the Google Solution Challenge?
- **Overview**: The Google Solution Challenge 2025 is an annual global competition by Google for university students. You create a functional project—like an app, website, or tool—using at least one Google technology (e.g., Firebase, TensorFlow, Google Cloud) to address a real-world issue tied to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Examples include reducing poverty, improving health, or fighting climate change.
- **Purpose**: It’s designed to sharpen your coding skills, encourage teamwork (or solo work), and make a positive impact globally or locally.
- **Who It’s For**: University students (undergraduate or graduate) who are part of a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) or willing to join one. No prior experience required—open to all skill levels!

### What Do We Have to Build?
- You’ll build a **working solution**—a practical piece of tech (e.g., mobile app, web platform, or hardware-software combo) that solves an SDG-related problem. It must be functional, not just a concept.
- **Examples**: An app to teach rural kids (SDG 4: Education), a tool to track carbon emissions (SDG 13: Climate Action), or an AI health checker (SDG 3: Health).

### What Are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
The SDGs are 17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 to improve the world by 2030. Here’s the full list:
1. **No Poverty**: End poverty everywhere.
2. **Zero Hunger**: Ensure everyone has food.
3. **Good Health and Well-being**: Promote healthy lives.
4. **Quality Education**: Make education accessible.
5. **Gender Equality**: Empower women and girls.
6. **Clean Water and Sanitation**: Provide safe water and sanitation.
7. **Affordable and Clean Energy**: Use sustainable energy.
8. **Decent Work and Economic Growth**: Create good jobs.
9. **Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**: Build smart tech.
10. **Reduced Inequalities**: Make life fairer.
11. **Sustainable Cities and Communities**: Make cities safe and green.
12. **Responsible Consumption and Production**: Use resources wisely.
13. **Climate Action**: Fight climate change.
14. **Life Below Water**: Protect oceans and marine life.
15. **Life on Land**: Save forests and wildlife.
16. **Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions**: Build fair societies.
17. **Partnerships for the Goals**: Work together globally.

Choose one (or more) and create a solution for a related issue!

### What Are Some Solution Ideas?
- **SDG 1 (Poverty)**: App to connect job seekers with local employers.
- **SDG 3 (Health)**: AI tool to detect diseases from photos.
- **SDG 6 (Water)**: System to monitor water quality in Pakistan’s rivers.
- **SDG 11 (Cities)**: Safety app with emergency alerts for urban commuters.

### How to Use Technologies?
- You integrate Google tools into your project to make it work. For example:
  - **Firebase**: Store data or manage user accounts.
  - **TensorFlow**: Add AI/ML features (e.g., predictions or image analysis).
  - **Google Cloud**: Host your app or handle big data.
- **Example**: For an education app, use Firebase to save student progress and TensorFlow to recommend lessons.

### What Technologies or AI Can We Use?
- You **must use at least one Google technology**. Options include:
  - **Firebase**: Manages app data and users.
  - **TensorFlow**: Builds AI/ML models (e.g., voice recognition).
  - **Google Cloud Platform**: Hosts or scales projects.
  - **Flutter**: Creates apps for Android/iOS.
  - **Android**: Builds mobile apps.
  - **Google Maps**: Adds location features.
  - **Gemini API**: Powers AI chatbots or text tools.
  - **Google Assistant**: Adds voice control.
  - More: Wear OS, Angular, DialogFlow, Vertex AI, etc.
- **AI Optional**: Use AI if it fits (e.g., TensorFlow), but simple apps without AI are fine too.
- **Other Tech**: Add Python, JavaScript, etc., as long as Google tech is central.

### Does the Code Have to Be Self-Written?
- **Yes**, your team must write the main code. You can’t copy entire projects, but:
  - Use Google libraries (e.g., TensorFlow models) or open-source snippets as helpers.
  - Submit a GitHub repo with your code and a README explaining how to run it.

### What Do We Submit?
By the deadline (likely **March 28, 2025**), submit:
1. **Demo Video**: A 2-minute video showing your project in action (upload to YouTube, public or unlisted).
   - Show how it works, how users interact, and the Google tech used.
2. **Project Form**: Includes:
   - Team info (names, university, contact).
   - Project details (SDG, Google tech, problem solved).
   - Links to your video and GitHub repo.

### Can I Participate Solo or Twice?
- **Solo**: Yes! Teams can be 1-4 people, so solo is allowed.
- **Twice (Solo + Team)**: No, only one entry per person per year—choose solo or team.

### Is GDSC Membership Compulsory?
- **Yes**, at least one team member must be in a GDSC by submission time.
- **Not in One?**: Join at [goo.gle/solutionchallenge](https://goo.gle/solutionchallenge) or a nearby GDSC (e.g., COMSATS Lahore).
- **GDG vs. GDSC**: GDG is for pros; GDSC is for students—this requires GDSC.

### How Are Projects Judged?
Judges score based on:
- **Impact (50%)**: Does it solve the SDG problem well? Is the goal clear and measurable?
- **Technology (50%)**: How effectively is Google tech used? Is it innovative and scalable?
- Key Areas: Problem clarity, user feedback, technical execution, future potential.
