## Part 1: Understanding the Google Solution Challenge 2025

### What is the Google Solution Challenge?
- **Overview**: The Google Solution Challenge 2025 is an annual competition hosted by Google, inviting university students worldwide to develop innovative, functional projects—such as apps, websites, or hybrid solutions—using at least one Google technology (e.g., Firebase, TensorFlow, Google Cloud). These projects must address a pressing issue aligned with the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including poverty reduction, healthcare improvement, or climate action.
- **Mission**: This challenge aims to enhance your technical skills, foster collaboration (or solo effort), and drive meaningful global or local impact by 2030.
- **Target Audience**: Open to all university students (undergraduate or graduate) affiliated with a Google Developer Student Club (GSC) or eager to join one. No prior experience is necessary—everyone is welcome!

### What Should You Build?
- **Requirement**: You must create a **functional solution**—a working tech product (e.g., a mobile app, web platform, or hardware-software integration) that tackles an SDG-related problem, not just a theoretical concept.
- **Inspiration**: Think big yet practical! Examples include:
  - A mobile app delivering offline lessons to rural students (SDG 4: Quality Education).
  - A tool tracking carbon footprints in urban Pakistan (SDG 13: Climate Action).
  - An AI-powered health diagnostic tool for remote areas (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being).

### Exploring the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

- **SDG 6 (Clean Water)**: A system monitoring river pollution in the Indus River basin.
- **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)**: A safety app with real-time alerts for Karachi commuters.

### Leveraging Google Technologies
- **Integration**: Incorporate at least one Google tool to power your project. Examples include:
  - **Firebase**: Manage user data, send notifications, or store project info.
  - **TensorFlow**: Implement AI/ML for predictions or image recognition.
  - **Google Cloud**: Host your app or process large datasets.
  - **Flutter**: Build cross-platform mobile apps.
  - **Google Maps**: Add location-based features.
  - **Gemini API**: Enhance with AI-driven text or chat capabilities.
- **Example**: For an education app, use Firebase to track student progress and TensorFlow to personalize learning recommendations.
- **Flexibility**: Combine with other languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) as long as Google tech is central.

### Eligible Technologies and AI
- **Mandatory**: Use at least one Google technology from the list above (Firebase, TensorFlow, etc.).
- **AI Options**: Incorporate AI (e.g., TensorFlow for machine learning) if it fits your solution, but it’s optional—simple projects are equally valid.
- **Additional Tools**: Supplement with Wear OS, Angular, DialogFlow, Vertex AI, or other tech, ensuring Google tools are the core.

### Code Ownership Requirements
- **Original Work**: Your team must write the primary code. You cannot submit copied projects, but:
  - Use Google-provided libraries (e.g., TensorFlow models) or open-source code snippets as support.
  - Include a GitHub repo with your code and a README with setup instructions (e.g., “Install Flutter, run `flutter run`”).

### Submission Requirements
- **Components**:
  1. **Demo Video**: A 2-minute video (uploaded to YouTube, public or unlisted) demonstrating your project in action—show functionality, user interaction, and Google tech usage.
  2. **Project Form**: Complete the form at [goo.gle/solutionchallenge](https://goo.gle/solutionchallenge) with:
     - Team details (names, university, contact info, GDSC affiliation).
     - Project overview (SDG, Google tech, problem addressed).
     - Links to your YouTube video and GitHub repo.

### Participation Rules
- **Solo or Team**: Teams can have 1-4 members, so solo participation is allowed.
- **One Entry Per Person**: You cannot submit both solo and as part of a team—choose one entry per year.

### GDSC Membership Requirement
- **Mandatory**: At least one team member must be part of a GDGoC by the submission deadline(30 April)
- **How to Join**: Sign up via [goo.gle/solutionchallenge](https://goo.gle/solutionchallenge) or connect with a nearby GDGoC (e.g., COMSATS Lahore, NUST Islamabad).
- **GDG vs. GDSC**: GDG is for professionals; GDGoC is student-focused—this requires GDSC affiliation.

### Judging Criteria
- **Evaluation**: Projects are scored on:
  - **Impact (50%)**: Does it effectively address the SDG? Is the solution clear, measurable, and impactful?
  - **Technology (50%)**: How well is Google tech integrated? Is the solution innovative and scalable?
- **Focus Areas**: Judges assess problem definition, user feedback, technical implementation, and future potential.
