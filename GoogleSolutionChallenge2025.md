## Part 1: Understanding the Google Solution Challenge 2025

### What is the Google Solution Challenge?
- **Overview**: The Google Solution Challenge 2025 is an annual competition hosted by Google, inviting university students worldwide to develop innovative, functional projects—such as apps, websites, or hybrid solutions—using at least one Google technology (e.g., Firebase, TensorFlow, Google Cloud). These projects must address a pressing issue aligned with the Themes, including poverty reduction, healthcare improvement, or climate action.
- **Mission**: This challenge aims to enhance your technical skills, foster collaboration (or solo effort), and drive meaningful global or local impact by 2030.
- **Target Audience**: Open to all university students (undergraduate or graduate) affiliated with a Google Developer Group on Campus (GDGoC) or eager to join one. No prior experience is necessary—everyone is welcome!

### What Should You Build?
- **Requirement**: You must create a **functional solution**—a working tech product (e.g., a mobile app, web platform, or hardware-software integration) that tackles an SDG-related problem, not just a theoretical concept.
- **Inspiration**: Think big yet practical! Examples include:
  - A mobile app delivering offline lessons to rural students (SDG 4: Quality Education).
  - A tool tracking carbon footprints in urban Pakistan (SDG 13: Climate Action).
  - An AI-powered health diagnostic tool for remote areas (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being).

### Leveraging Google Technologies
- **Integration**: Incorporate at least one Google tool to power your project. Examples include:
  - **Firebase**: Manage user data, send notifications, or store project info.
  - **TensorFlow**: Implement AI/ML for predictions or image recognition.
  - **Google Cloud**: Host your app or process large datasets.
  - **Flutter**: Build cross-platform mobile apps.
  - **Google Maps**: Add location-based features.
  - **Gemini API**: Enhance with AI-driven text or chat capabilities.
- **Example**: For an education app, use Firebase to track student progress and TensorFlow to personalize learning recommendations.
- **Flexibility**: Combine with other languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) as long as Google tech is central.

### Eligible Technologies and AI
- **Mandatory**: Use at least one Google technology from the list above (Firebase, TensorFlow, etc.).
- **AI Options**: Incorporate AI (e.g., TensorFlow for machine learning) if it fits your solution, but it’s optional—simple projects are equally valid.
- **Additional Tools**: Supplement with Wear OS, Angular, DialogFlow, Vertex AI, or other tech, ensuring Google tools are the core.

### Code Ownership Requirements
- **Original Work**: Your team must write the primary code. You cannot submit copied projects, but:
  - Use Google-provided libraries (e.g., TensorFlow models) or open-source code snippets as support.
  - Include a GitHub repo with your code and a README with setup instructions (e.g., “Install Flutter, run `flutter run`”).

     - Team details (names, university, contact info, GDGoC affiliation).
     - Project overview (SDG, Google tech, problem addressed).
     - Links to your YouTube video and GitHub repo.

### Participation Rules
- **Team**: Teams can have upto 1-4 members, so solo participation is allowed.
- **One Entry Per Person**: You can submit as a part of a team—choose one entry per year.

### GDGoC Membership Requirement
- **Mandatory**: At least one team member must be part of a GDGoC by the submission deadline(30 April)
