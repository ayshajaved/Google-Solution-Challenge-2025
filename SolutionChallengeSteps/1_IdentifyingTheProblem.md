# Step 1: Identifying the Problem

The first step to winning the Google Solution Challenge 2025 is finding a **real-world problem** tied to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Your solution must address an SDG, so let’s break down how to identify a meaningful, solvable problem in this guide.

## The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The SDGs are global targets set by the United Nations in 2015 to improve the world by 2030. Pick one (or combine a few) that inspires you! Here’s the full list with brief explanations:

1. **No Poverty**: End poverty in all forms everywhere.
2. **Zero Hunger**: End hunger and ensure food security.
3. **Good Health and Well-being**: Promote healthy lives for all ages.
4. **Quality Education**: Ensure inclusive, quality education for all.
5. **Gender Equality**: Achieve equality and empower women and girls.
6. **Clean Water and Sanitation**: Provide safe water and sanitation for all.
7. **Affordable and Clean Energy**: Ensure access to sustainable energy.
8. **Decent Work and Economic Growth**: Promote good jobs and economic growth.
9. **Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**: Build resilient infrastructure and innovation.
10. **Reduced Inequalities**: Reduce income and social inequalities.
11. **Sustainable Cities and Communities**: Make cities safe, sustainable, and inclusive.
12. **Responsible Consumption and Production**: Ensure sustainable use of resources.
13. **Climate Action**: Combat climate change and its impacts.
14. **Life Below Water**: Protect oceans, seas, and marine life.
15. **Life on Land**: Protect forests, land ecosystems, and biodiversity.
16. **Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions**: Build peaceful and fair societies.
17. **Partnerships for the Goals**: Strengthen global collaboration for development.

## How to Identify the Problem
To pick a winning problem, ask yourself these key questions:

1. **What’s the Scope?**  
   - **Local**: Affects your community, city, or country (e.g., water scarcity in Lahore).  
   - **Global**: Affects the world (e.g., climate change education).  
   - Tip: Local problems are easier to research and test, but global ones can have broader appeal.

2. **Who’s Affected?**  
   - Identify the **target users** (e.g., students, farmers, women, urban commuters).  
   - Example: Rural kids lacking education (SDG 4) or city workers needing jobs (SDG 8).

3. **Is It Measurable?**  
   - Can you define success? (e.g., “Help 100 farmers reduce crop waste” vs. “Fix hunger”).  
   - Judges love clear, specific goals.

4. **Does It Match an SDG?**  
   - Link your problem directly to one or more SDGs. Example: Pollution in Karachi rivers ties to SDG 6 (Clean Water).

## Domains to Explore
Here are some domains where SDG problems often arise. Choose one based on your skills or passion:
- **Health**: Disease detection, mental health support (SDG 3).
- **Education**: Access to learning, skill-building (SDG 4).
- **Environment**: Climate tracking, waste reduction (SDG 13, 12).
- **Equality**: Women’s safety, job opportunities (SDG 5, 10).
- **Technology**: Smart cities, infrastructure (SDG 9, 11).
- **Food & Water**: Hunger relief, clean water systems (SDG 2, 6).

## Quick Problem Examples
Here are some ideas to get you started:

| SDG | Problem | Domain | Region | Google Tech Idea |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|------------------|
| 3 (Health) | Lack of affordable mental health support for students | Health | Global | TensorFlow for mood detection |
| 6 (Water) | Contaminated drinking water in rural areas | Environment | Pakistan | Google Cloud for real-time monitoring |
| 11 (Cities) | Traffic congestion in urban centers | Technology | Local (e.g., Lahore) | Google Maps for route optimization |
| 13 (Climate) | No early flood warnings for farmers | Environment | Sindh, Pakistan | Firebase for alerts |
| 4 (Education) | Limited access to coding skills for girls | Education | Global | Flutter for an interactive app |

## Where to Find Problems
Look for inspiration from these sources:
1. **Your Community**: Talk to friends, family, or locals about daily struggles (e.g., floods in Sindh).
2. **News**: Check local/global headlines (e.g., Dawn, BBC) for SDG-related issues.
3. **X Posts**: Search X for real-time discussions (e.g., #ClimateChange, #EducationForAll).
4. **Past Winners**: Review Google Solution Challenge Demo Days on YouTube for ideas (e.g., ATTI, Spoon Share).
5. **UN Data**: Visit [sdgs.un.org/goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) for stats on each SDG.

---

## Resources for Research
- **X Search**: Use keywords like “#SDG4 Pakistan” or “climate change issues” to find real-time struggles.
- **Google News**: Filter by your country (e.g., Pakistan) for local SDG issues.
- **UN SDG Tracker**: [unstats.un.org/sdgs](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs) for data by region.
- **GDSC Community**: Ask your GDSC peers or mentors for local insights.

---

## What to Prioritize
Not all problems are equal. Focus on these traits to stand out:
- **Urgency**: Is it a pressing issue? (e.g., flood warnings vs. a vague “better future”).
- **Feasibility**: Can you solve it with your skills and Google tech in 2-3 months?
- **Impact**: Does it help a specific group meaningfully? (e.g., “rural women” beats “everyone”).
- **Innovation**: Can you add a fresh twist? (e.g., AI for water testing vs. a basic app).
- **Scalability**: Could it grow beyond your initial scope?

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Too Broad**: “End world hunger” is noble but unrealistic. Narrow it to “reduce food waste in my city.”
- **No SDG Link**: If it’s just a cool app idea without an SDG tie, it won’t qualify.
- **Ignoring Users**: Don’t assume—talk to real people (e.g., farmers, students) to confirm the problem exists.
- **Unfeasible**: Avoid ideas needing years or tech you can’t learn by March 2025.

---

## Pro Tip: Find Your “Why”
Judges love passion! Pick a problem you or your community care about deeply—your story will shine in the demo video. For example, 2024’s ATTI won because the team connected it to South Korea’s dementia crisis, a personal cause for them.

## Problem Identification Checklist
Before moving to Step 2, tick off these boxes to ensure your problem is solid:
- [ ] **SDG-Aligned**: Does it clearly tie to one or more of the 17 SDGs?
- [ ] **Specific**: Can you describe it in 1-2 sentences without being vague?
- [ ] **Research-Backed**: Have you found evidence (e.g., news, X posts, stats) it’s a real issue?
- [ ] **User-Focused**: Do you know who it affects and how?
- [ ] **Solvable**: Can you address it with your skills and Google tech in 2-3 months?

---

## Action Plan
1. **Brainstorm**: Write down 3-5 problems you care about tied to SDGs.
2. **Research**: Check X, news, or talk to people to validate each idea.
3. **Narrow Down**: Pick one problem based on urgency, feasibility, and passion.
4. **Define It**: Write a 1-sentence problem statement.  
   - Example: “Rural Pakistani farmers lack real-time flood alerts, risking crop loss (SDG 13).”
