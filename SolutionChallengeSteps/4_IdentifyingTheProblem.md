# Step 4: Identifying the Problem

The first step to winning the Google Solution Challenge 2025 is finding a **real-world problem** tied to the theme. Your solution must address a Theme, so let’s break down how to identify a meaningful, solvable problem in this guide.

## How to Identify the Problem
To pick a winning problem, ask yourself these key questions:

1. **What’s the Scope?**  
   - **Local**: Affects your community, city, or country (e.g., water scarcity in Lahore).  
   - **Global**: Affects the world (e.g., climate change education).  
   - Tip: Local problems are easier to research and test, but global ones can have broader appeal.

2. **Who’s Affected?**  
   - Identify the **target users** (e.g., students, farmers, women, urban commuters).  
   - Example: Rural kids lacking education (SDG 4) or city workers needing jobs (SDG 8).

3. **Is It Measurable?**  
   - Can you define success? (e.g., “Help 100 farmers reduce crop waste” vs. “Fix hunger”).  
   - Judges love clear, specific goals.

4. **Does It Match an SDG?**  
   - Link your problem directly to one or more SDGs. Example: Pollution in Karachi rivers ties to SDG 6 (Clean Water).

## Domains to Explore
Choose one based on your skills or passion:
- **Health**: Disease detection, mental health support
- **Education**: Access to learning, skill-building 
- **Environment**: Climate tracking, waste reduction
- **Equality**: Women’s safety, job opportunities
- **Technology**: Smart cities, infrastructure 
- **Food & Water**: Hunger relief, clean water systems

## Where to Find Problems
Look for inspiration from these sources:
1. **Your Community**: Talk to friends, family, or locals about daily struggles (e.g., floods in Sindh).
2. **News**: Check local/global headlines (e.g., Dawn, BBC) for SDG-related issues.
3. **X Posts**: Search X for real-time discussions (e.g., #ClimateChange, #EducationForAll).
4. **Past Winners**: Review Google Solution Challenge Demo Days on YouTube for ideas (e.g., ATTI, Spoon Share).
5. **UN Data**: Visit [sdgs.un.org/goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) for stats on each SDG.

## What to Prioritize
Not all problems are equal. Focus on these traits to stand out:
- **Urgency**: Is it a pressing issue? (e.g., flood warnings vs. a vague “better future”).
- **Feasibility**: Can you solve it with your skills and Google tech in 2-3 months?
- **Impact**: Does it help a specific group meaningfully? (e.g., “rural women” beats “everyone”).
- **Innovation**: Can you add a fresh twist? (e.g., AI for water testing vs. a basic app).
- **Scalability**: Could it grow beyond your initial scope?

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Too Broad**: “End world hunger” is noble but unrealistic. Narrow it to “reduce food waste in my city.”
- **Ignoring Users**: Don’t assume—talk to real people (e.g., farmers, students) to confirm the problem exists.
- **Unfeasible**: Avoid ideas needing years or tech you can’t learn by March 2025.

## Pro Tip: Find Your “Why”
Judges love passion! Pick a problem you or your community care about deeply—your story will shine in the demo video. For example, 2024’s ATTI won because the team connected it to South Korea’s dementia crisis, a personal cause for them.

---

## Validation Mini-Experiment
Before finalizing, test your problem’s relevance:
- **Quick Survey**: Ask 5-10 people (friends, locals) if they face this issue.
- **X Poll**: Post a question (e.g., “Do floods affect your crops?”) and check responses.
- **Prototype Sketch**: Draw a basic app screen—does it feel useful?
Example: For SDG 6 (Water), ask rural neighbors if water quality worries them.

## Google Tech Teaser
Once you pick a problem, Google tech can bring it to life:
- **Health Issue?** TensorFlow could detect symptoms.
- **Water Crisis?** Google Cloud could track data.
- **Education Gap?** Flutter could build a sleek app.
Think ahead—your problem should play to Google’s strengths!

## Problem Identification Checklist
Before moving to Step 2, tick off these boxes to ensure your problem is solid:
- [ ] **theme-Aligned**: Does it clearly tie to one or more of the theme?
- [ ] **Specific**: Can you describe it in 1-2 sentences without being vague?
- [ ] **Research-Backed**: Have you found evidence (e.g., news, X posts, stats) it’s a real issue?
- [ ] **User-Focused**: Do you know who it affects and how?
- [ ] **Solvable**: Can you address it with your skills and Google tech in 2-3 months?
